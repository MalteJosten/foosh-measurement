# FooSH - Measurement Code

This repository contains the code necessary to perform the measurements described in my Master Thesis [_FooSH: A framework for outcome-oriented Smart Homes_](https://github.com/mj-ude/ma-thesis).

- The measurement station's [code](https://github.com/MalteJosten/foosh-measurement/tree/main/measurement-station).
- The [code](https://github.com/MalteJosten/foosh-measurement/tree/main/measurement-hub) for the hub.

It also provides the collected [measurement data](https://github.com/MalteJosten/foosh-measurement/tree/main/measurement-data.zip) that was used for the creation of the Prediction Model discussed in the thesis.

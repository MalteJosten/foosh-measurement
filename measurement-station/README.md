# Measurement Station
## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- 10kÎ© resistor
- Photoresistor
- Breadboard

## Hardware Configuration
All the components were mounted on a breadboard according to the following schematic:

## Scripts
There a two micropython scripts:
1. `sensor_raw.py` and
2. `sensor_sequence.py`

The first script measures a single brightness value and transmits it to the hub.<br>
The second script takes multiple measurements and transmits their average to the hub.

The corresponding parameters may need to be adapted.

You also need to provide a `secrets.py` file with the fields `SSID` and `PWD` to be able to connect to the local wireless network.

### Measuring brightness
First, the Raspberry Pi Pico W needs to be flashed with the latest firmware and micropython version (which can be found [here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/)).

After successfully flashing the microcontroller, you can use a graphical user interface program like [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) or a commandline-based tool like [ampy](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-ampy/) or [rshell](https://pypi.org/project/rshell/) to write the scripts onto the microcontroller.

Renaming the script `sensor_....py` to `main.py` ensures that the script is executed as soon as the microcontroller is powered on. Thus, no manual invoking of the script(s) is needed.
